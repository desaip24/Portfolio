“I rarely come across real talents who stand out like Peter. I had the pleasure of working with Peter for three years at the Big Corp, collaborating on several project teams. Peter’s ability to handle multiple projects was unlike any I’ve seen before and made a dramatic increase in the productivity level of our company. No matter how tense a meeting, Peter made sure everyone left with a smile. As a team member or a leader, Peter earns my highest recommendation.”

It was a pleasure working with Parth as a team member at TCS. During that time Parth was under my mentor-ship of Drupal 7 and 8. We worked on many Drupal-based projects together. I have to tell you that he is a quick learner, flexible and resolute. The thing I most like about Parth is, he has never hesitated to ask questions in doubt. He is not only reliable but also an inspiring team member. As a team member, Parth earns my highest recommendation.

Parth is a proactive and tireless contributor who would make a great addition to any team. Parth was assigned to my team as Drupal 7 developer as a trainee with zero knowledge of Drupal. I was surprised by the learning capability of this young boy. In just a few weeks he expertizes the core concept of Drupal 7. Throughout the period, Parth completed her task on time and never failed to add an extra touch when appropriate. He is always capable of adapting to new technologies.
